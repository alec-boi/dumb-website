                    <p>Van Gogh - Sunflowers</p>
                    <p>Some of Vincent van Gogh's most famous works are his Sunflower series. He painted a total of eleven of these canvases, although the most commonly referred to are the seven he painted while in Arles in 1888 - 1889.</p>

                    <p>Van Gogh - Starry Night</p>
                    <p>After experiencing a mental breakdown in the winter of 1888, van Gogh checked himself in to the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum near Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. The view became the basis of his most iconic work.</p>

                    <p>Edvard Munch - The Scream</p>
                    <p>The Scream is undoubtedly Edvard Munch’s most well-known painting. Painted in Berlin and Åsgårdsstrand in the 1890’s, it reflects Munch's feelings about the human condition and the new, modern century of the 1900s.</p>

                    <p>Van Gogh - Irises</p>
                    <p>When he painted the irises, he placed purple flowers against a yellow background but today the red pigment has faded and the flowers have turned blue. Even then his art is praised because each one of Van Gogh's irises is unique.</p>

                    <p>Gustave Caillebotte - Paris Street Rainy Day</p>
                    <p>Although Caillebotte was passionate about helping his Impressionist friends and was a talented artist himself, his paintings have the characteristics of Realism. He is sometimes linked with the very early Impressionists</p>

                    <p>Johannes Vermeer - Girl With a Pearl Earring</p>
                    <p>According to scholars, this painting was completed in 1665 and according to journalists Jean-Louis Vaudoyer and Lawrence Weschler proposed that the girl in the painting could be the oldest of Vermeer’s 10 children; Maria. Who she truly is, is still a realm of speculation</p>
